If you haven't heard already, web components have started to take off in popularity. The features they bring to the table is very compelling. Among them are: framework-agnostic reusable components, strong style encapsulation, and blazingly fast performance.

A few of the more popular tools for building web component libraries include [lit](https://lit.dev), [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/), and even the popular JavaScript frameworks can output web components now (you can play with some of them at [webcomponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/)), but for the last few weeks I have had the opportunity to work with [Microsoft's FAST Element](https://fast.design) and I am pretty impressed with it.

One thing that I struggled with as I started out, was finding a standard way to stand up dev environments so I could experiment and ideate with FAST components. The FAST team doesn't provide a way (yet), so I went ahead and [built a quick one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-fast-element) for us to experiment with. I will be using it to generate the examples used in this article.

In your terminal or command environment run the following command and follow the instructions to set up your local environment:

```bash
npm init fast-element my-fast-components
```

## Creating a New Component

In the `/src` directory, let's create a new folder and file called `/my-search/index.ts` and add our component definition to it.

```ts
import { FASTElement, customElement } from '@microsoft/fast-element';

/**
 * @tag my-search
 * 
 * @summary This is a search component
 *
 */
@customElement('my-search')
export class MySearch extends FASTElement {

}
```

Here we are using FAST's library to define and create our custom element - `<my-search></my-search>` - but we will also be using [jsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to help document our custom element, integrate it with the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and generate our [custom element manifest](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/).

Now we can export our component from the `./src/index.ts` to include it with the rest of our components in our library.

```ts
export * from './my-counter';
export * from './my-search'; // added for our new component
```

### Adding Stories

Storybook provides a great workspace for us to build and experiment with our components. Once we set up the initial file, our custom elements manifest will handle a lot of the heavy lifting for us.

To get started, create a file called `/my-search/my-search.stories.ts` and add the following contents:

```ts
import "./index";

export default {
    title: 'Components/My Search',
    component: 'my-search'
};

const Template = (args: any) => `
    <my-search></my-search>
`;

export const Default: any = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {};
```

Now, we can start Storybook with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once Storybook opens in a new browser tab, we should see a section on in the left column - `Components > My Search > Default`. The `Default` page will be blank. If you inspect the white canvas, you will see our component on the page, but since we haven't given it anything to render the browser treats is like an empty `<span>` element. Let's add some content.

### Adding HTML

To add HTML to our component, let's update out component's class decorator in `src/my-search/index.ts` with the following code:

```ts
@customElement({
    name: 'my-search',
    template: html`
        <label>
            My Search
            <input type="search" />
        </label>
        <button>Search</button>
    `
})
```

If your editor didn't already, you will need to make sure you update your import statement to include the `html` string template decorator.

```ts
import { FASTElement, customElement, html } from '@microsoft/fast-element';
```

You should now see the label, input field, and search button for our component rendered in the `Default` Storybook page.

## Attributes or Properties

Regular HTML elements have attributes (sometimes called properties) that you can pass values to create a specific behavior. For example, the `input` element has attributes like `type`, `name`, `value`, and `disabled`. Those values will make the element look and behave a certain way. Since we are creating _custom elements_, we can define our own attributes and map them to a behavior.

Let's start with making it possible to change the label for the input field. FAST uses the `@attr` decorator to identify these fields. We can add it to our component class along with the type and default value.

```ts
export class MySearch extends FASTElement {
    @attr label: string = 'My Search';
}
```

Again, you will need to update import statement to include the new `attr` decorator.

```ts
import { FASTElement, customElement, html, attr } from '@microsoft/fast-element';
```

Also, make sure to update the jsDoc comment above the class so that the values get defined in the custom element manifest and synced up with Storybook.

```ts
/**
 * @tag my-search
 * 
 * @summary This is a search component
 *
 * @attr {string} label - the label associated with the search field
 * 
 */
```

### Binding Attributes to Templates

To help provide some autocomplete functionality, we can add our component's class as a type on our template string.

```ts
template: html<MySearch>`
```

Now, let's replace the "My Search" text with the value provided in the attribute field. We can do this with some template string interpolation and an arrow function that returns our attribute (calling attributes and methods using this arrow function syntax is important for efficient template updates).

```ts
template: html<MySearch>`
    <label>
        ${x => x.label}
        <input type="search" />
    </label>
    <button>Search</button>
`
```

### Adding Attributes in Storybook

If we update the template in our `my-search.stories.ts` with a `label` attribute and value, we should see it reflected in our Storybook page.

```ts
const Template = (args: any) => `
    <my-search label="Site Search"></my-search>
`;
```

Rather than making a code change every time we want to see different values passed to our component, we can leverage Storybook controls and interact with our components though the UI.

```ts
const Template = (args: any) => `
    <my-search label="${args.label}"></my-search>
`;
```

For some reason the default value is not automatically defined, so we will need to add it to the `args` section of our default export.

```ts
export default {
    title: 'Components/My Search',
    component: 'my-search',
    args: {
       label: 'My Search' 
    }
};
```

In the "Addons" panel under the "Controls" tab you should see a section called "Properties" with an input for the `label` attribute.

If you don't see the "Addons" panel to the right or bottom of your component, click the menu button in the upper-left side of the page and select "Show addons". We will be using that a lot.

## Slots

Attributes are a great way to pass data like `strings`, `numbers`, `objects`, and `arrays` into components, but sometimes you need to be able to pass markup or HTML into a component. That's exactly what [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) are for. It's basically a placeholder for your content to go.

In our component, we will use a `slot` so we can pass content into our search `button`. Let's start by updating our template with a slot inside of the button. We can also define default content by adding it between the opening and closing `<slot>` tags. If slotted content exists, it will override what we have added between the tags.

```ts
template: html<MySearch>`
    <label>
        ${x => x.label}
        <input type="search" />
    </label>
    <button>
        <slot>Search</slot>
    </button>
`
```

Let's also update our jsDoc comments above our component to include it in our custom elements manifest.

```ts
/**
 * @tag my-search
 * 
 * @summary This is a search component
 *
 * @attr {string} label - the label associated with the search field
 * 
 * @slot default - content displayed in the search button
 * 
 */
```

You should now see a new section in your Storybook controls called "Slots". Now we can wire that attribute up in our template in the `my-search.stories.ts` file as well as a default value for the argument.

```ts
export default {
    title: 'Components/My Search',
    component: 'my-search',
    args: {
       label: 'My Search',
       default: 'Search'
    }
};

const Template = (args: any) => `
    <my-search label="${args.label}">${args.default}</my-search>
`;
```

New we can pass in any value we want like "Submit" or an emoji ("ðŸ˜‰"). We can even create a new template in Storybook and pull in an icon library.

```ts
// using Bootstrap icons - https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
const IconTemplate = (args: any) => `
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.8.0/font/bootstrap-icons.css" />
    <my-search label="${args.label}">${args.default}</my-search>
`;

export const Icon: any = IconTemplate.bind({});
Icon.args = {
    default: "<i class=\"bi bi-search\"></i>"
};
```

## Events

We use `attributes` and `slots` to pass data into our components, but sometimes we need to get data out of our components. We can do this through emitting events.

We interact with native HTMl element events all of the time - `onClick`, `onInput`, `onBlur`, etc. FAST makes this pretty easy for us using the `$emit()` method provided in the `FASTElement` class our component inherits from.

### Listening for Events

In our component, we want to emit an event any time a user triggers the [search event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/search_event) on our input or clicks on our search `button`. To do this, let's add two event handler methods to our component class that will emit our own "find" event.

```ts
export class MySearch extends FASTElement {
    @attr label: string = 'My Search';

    private searchHandler() {
        this.$emit('find');
    }

    private buttonClickHandler() {
        this.$emit('find');
    }
}
```

Now we can wire the methods up to our component's template.

```ts
template: html<MySearch>`
    <label>
        ${x => x.label}
        <input type="search" @search="${x => x.searchHandler()}" />
    </label>
    <button @click="${x => x.buttonClickHandler()}">
        <slot>Search</slot>
    </button>
`,
```

As you can see, FAST uses a different syntax for [listening for events](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/declaring-templates#events) on elements. Rather than the normal `onSearch` or `onClick`, they use `@search` and `@click`. If you have ever used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), then FAST's attribute and event binding syntax should look familiar.

Now we should be able to listen for an `onFind` event on our `<my-search>` element. You can do this by adding an `onFind` attribute to your element or using JavaScript to select our element and adding an event listener.

```ts
// select the element from the DOM
const mySearch = document.querySelector('my-search');

// add an event listener for our custom event and log it to the console
mySearch.addEventListener('find', e => console.log(e));
```

### Capturing Events in Storybook

Rather than having to constantly add event listeners to our code or to the console any time we want to test our events, we can wire them up in Storybook and it will capture it for us. In our story's default export, we add a new `parameters` property to the object where we can define our custom events.

```ts
export default {
    title: 'Components/My Search',
    component: 'my-search',
    args: {
       label: 'My Search',
       default: 'Search',
       ['--font-size']: '1rem',
       ['--padding']: '0.25rem'
    },
    parameters: {
        actions: {
            handles: ['find'],
        },
    },
};
```

Now can we can see the event logged in the "Actions" tab along with the event information whenever our `filter` event is emitted.

### Using Directives

The last thing we need to do is to add our input value to the emitted event so we can use it. We can select an element within our custom element using `querySelector`.

```ts
const input = this.shadowRoot.querySelector('input');
```

There's nothing wrong with this approach, but FAST provides us with a number of [directives](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/using-directives) that make common tasks simpler. In this case we can use the [`ref()` directive](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/using-directives#the-ref-directive) to reference the element in the component's context (`this`).

First, let's add `ref('searchInput')` to our input element (make sure you import `ref` from `@microsoft/fast-element`).

```ts
template: html<MySearch>`
    <label>
        ${x => x.label}
        <input type="search" ${ref('searchInput')} @search="${x => x.searchHandler()}" />
    </label>
    <button @click="${x => x.buttonClickHandler()}">
        <slot>Search</slot>
    </button>
`,
```

Next, we can add a property to our class that matches the string in our ref and assign it the type `HTMLInputElement`.

```ts
export class MySearch extends FASTElement {
    @attr label: string = 'My Search';
    searchInput: HTMLInputElement;
```

Finally, let's emit the input value of the input box with the search event.

```ts
private searchHandler() {
    this.$emit('find', this.searchInput.value);
}

private buttonClickHandler() {
    this.$emit('find', this.searchInput.value);
}
```

When we go back to Storybook, input a value, and press the "Enter" key or click the search button, we should now see the input's value under the `detail` property of the event data.

```ts
{
    bubbles: true,
    cancelBubble: false,
    cancelable: true,
    composed: true,
    currentTarget: HTMLDivElement,
    defaultPrevented: false,
    detail: "ergferf",      // <--
    eventPhase: 3,
    isTrusted: false,
    returnValue: true,
    srcElement: MySearch,
    target: undefined,
    timeStamp: 22556.699999928474,
    type: "find"
}
```

## Styling

I am planning on creating a separate post dedicated to styling web components, so this will be a basic overview of how to add styling to FAST elements.

We add styles by adding a `styles` property to our component definition class decorator and prefixing our template string with `css`.

```ts
@customElement({
    name: 'my-search',
    template: html<MySearch>`
        <label>
            ${x => x.label}
            <input type="search" />
        </label>
        <button>
            <slot>Search</slot>
        </button>
    `,
    styles: css``
})
```

We will also need to make sure we import `css` from FAST.

```ts
import { FASTElement, customElement, html, attr, css } from '@microsoft/fast-element';
```

Let's add some basic styling and then we can break it down.

```ts
styles: css<MySearch>`
    :host {
        --font-size: 1rem;
        --padding: 0.25rem;

        font-size: var(--font-size);
        display: block;
    }

    input {
        font-size: var(--font-size);
        padding: var(--padding);
    }

    button {
        cursor: pointer;
        font-size: var(--font-size);
        padding: var(--padding);
    }
`
```

### `:host`

The first thing you may have noticed is the strange `:host` selector. This targets our custom element's tag - `<my-search>`. This allows us to apply styles to the tag as well as define global styles for the element.

Custom elements apply the `display: inline;` style by default, so in our case we added the `display: block;` to ensure this would render the full width of the element's parent.

### Generic Selectors

You may have also noticed that we have HTML elements as selectors. _Don't freak out_, this was intentional. One of the nice things about the [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) is that it provides a layer of encapsulation. This means the component isn't affected by the styles outside of the component and the component's styles don't bleed out to the rest of the application. We don't have to worry about these styles affecting any of the other `inputs` or `buttons` in our application.

__NOTE:__ I don't recommend you build your components this way. I did it purely for demonstration purposes.

### CSS Custom Properties or CSS Variables

Since we cannot affect the styles of our components externally, we can add [CSS Custom Properties (aka - CSS Variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to our component to prove some customizations. With these defined, we can apply targeted custom styles to our components.

```css
my-search {
    --font-size: 1.5rem;
    --padding: 1rem;
}
```

Or even with inline styles in our markup:

```html
<my-search style="--font-size: 1.5rem;--padding: 1rem;"></my-search>
```

### Adding Custom Properties to Storybook

First, we will need to update our jsDoc with our new custom properties to include them in our custom elements manifest.

```ts
/**
 * @tag my-search
 * 
 * @summary This is a search component
 *
 * @attr {string} label - the label associated with the search field
 * 
 * @slot default - content displayed in the search button
 * 
 * @cssprop [--font-size=1rem] - Controls the font size for all elements in the component
 * @cssprop [--padding=0.25rem] - Controls the padding for the `input` and `button` elements
 * 
 */
```

We should now see a new section in controls tab called "CSS Custom Properties" with our properties listed. Let's add some default values to our story's default export.

```ts
export default {
    title: 'Components/My Search',
    component: 'my-search',
    args: {
       label: 'My Search',
       default: 'Search',
       ['--font-size']: '1rem',
       ['--padding']: '0.25rem'
    }
};
```

Now, let's wire them up to our Storybook template (feel free to do the same with our Icon template).

```ts
const Template = (args: any) => `
    <style>
        my-search {
            --font-size: ${args['--font-size']};
            --padding: ${args['--padding']};
        }
    </style>
    <my-search label="${args.label}">${args.default}</my-search>
`;
```
